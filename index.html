     <img src="../images/IMG_20220827_072350.jpg" width="750" height="750" alt="Picture with a quote"><br>This is the "graphic" for a blue hose which was bought by the purchasing staff at Uhaul.  We needed to switch hoses from the other supplier, because the quality was just too poor.  These previous hoses were red in color.  This new variety is blue in color, and seems to last considerably longer than the previous red ones.  I took a photo of the "graphic", because we may be in need of this hose as a replacement sometime in the future.  If the photo of this "graphic" is posted on internet here, then the info can be referenced at a future date, and we can easily purchase it, knowing it to be of good quality (much better than the red ones from before).<br><br>

     At the top and bottom sections of this "graphic", the cardboard sheet is of a bluish hue (it could be loosely referenced as a sheet, even though it is a specially cut out section of cardboard).  The bluish hue of this sheet is quite a bit like the color of the hose.  It is noteable that the hose is of such lasting quality.  It is good to have the manufacturer name and some of the other details of the hose listed in case we have to purchase it again in the future.
